*Commands:*

`subscribe [types=<pi_types>] [vendors=<vendors>] [regions=<regions]` - subscribe to restock notifications for the specified Pi types and vendors. If none specified, you will be subscribed to all. Note that each vendor parameter corresponds to exactly one region; vendors which operate in multiple regions, such as PiShop, will have multiple region-specific parameter options, such as `pishopus` and `pishopuk`. You may also subscribe to regions, in which case you will be subscribed to all vendors within that region.

`list types` - get a list of available pi types

`list subscriptions` - get a list of ids and descriptions of all notifications you are currently subscribed to
