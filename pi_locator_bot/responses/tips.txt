General Tips:

- Due to the global chip shortage and increased demand during the pandemic, Pis are in reeeally high demand right now. I'm far from the only bot sending out these types of notifications, so they're selling out really fast. Like, I'm talking "gone within 15 minutes of a restock" kind of fast. Make sure you have Slack notifications turned on so you don't miss any alerts!

- If buying from Adafruit, make sure you have an account with two factor authentication set up. In an effort to dissasuade scalping bots, Adafruit is only allowing accounts with 2FA configured to purchase Raspberry Pis. Other vendors may have similar policies; it's a good idea to check beforehand!
